  520:
    title: Unknown error
    tag: Cloudflare
    description: |
      This is a catch-all response for when a website behind Cloudflare returns something unexpected or something that is not tolerated/interpreted (protocol violation or empty response).

      While the 520 error can be triggered by very unique and strange edge-case scenarios, they are generally caused by:

      * Connection resets (following a successful TCP handshake)
      * Headers exceed the Cloudflare header size limit (over 8kb)
      * An empty response from origin
      * An invalid HTTP response
      * Missing response headers from an HTTP response
      * Presence of multiple Content-Length headers

    title: A Timeout Error
    tag: Cloudflare
    description: |
      Cloudflare was able to make a TCP connection to the website behind them, but it did not reply with an HTTP response before the connection timed out. Cloudflare will typically wait 100 seconds for a HTTP response from your server.

      If no response is sent by your server in that time, Cloudflare closes the connection and serves a 524 error page.

  525:
    title: SSL handshake failed
    description: |
      This error indicates that the SSL handshake between Cloudflare and the website behind it has occurred. This means that Cloudflare is set to use Full SSL in the Cloudflare settings for the domain, so Cloudflare attempts to make a connection using SSL (for requests beginning in `https://`) to the web server that hosts the domain.

      The most common causes include:

        * The website does not have a valid SSL certificate installed
        * The website is not listening on port `443`
        * The website does not support or is not configured properly to support SNI
        * The cipher suites that Cloudflare uses do not match what the origin accepts

    title: Invalid SSL certificate
    description: |
      This error happens where there's a problem validating the SSL certificate on the origin web server and the Cloudflare SSL configuration on the website is set to "Full SSL (Strict)".

      Some of the common causes of this are:
        * The certificate has expired
        * The certificate has been revoked
        * The certificate is self-signed
        * Your website configuration is serving a certificate for the wrong domain

    title: Origin DNS Error
    description: |
      Cloudflare cannot resolve the A/AAAA or CNAME DNS record requested. Even if Cloudflare is resolving correctly, the record cannot be found or is a CNAME record to an external domain that cannot be resolved.

      The Error Message the browser will see will show a 1016 error, but the actual HTTP response code is 530.

      The most common causes are:

        * Your Cloudflare DNS configuration does not have an A/AAAA DNS record that matches the origin IP address.
        * You have a *CNAME DNS record* pointing to an external domain that cannot be resolved.
        * You're using Cloudflare [Load Balancer](https://www.cloudflare.com/load-balancing/) and the origin host names (CNAMEs) in your default/region and fallback pools cannot be resolved via DNS.
