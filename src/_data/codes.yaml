  520:
    title: Unknown error
    tag: Cloudflare
    description: |
      This is a catch-all response for when a website behind Cloudflare returns something unexpected or something that is not tolerated/interpreted (protocol violation or empty response).

      While the 520 error can be triggered by very unique and strange edge-case scenarios, they are generally caused by:

      * Connection resets (following a successful TCP handshake)
      * Headers exceed the Cloudflare header size limit (over 8kb)
      * An empty response from origin
      * An invalid HTTP response
      * Missing response headers from an HTTP response
      * Presence of multiple Content-Length headers

    title: A Timeout Error
    tag: Cloudflare
    description: |
      Cloudflare was able to make a TCP connection to the website behind them, but it did not reply with an HTTP response before the connection timed out. Cloudflare will typically wait 100 seconds for a HTTP response from your server. If no response is sent by your server in that time, Cloudflare closes the connection and serves a 524 error page.
